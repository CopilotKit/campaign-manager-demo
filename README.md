npm i
```

### 2. Set the required environment variables:

copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and populate the required environment variables.

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### 4. Use the Copilot

Create a new campaign, or edit an existing campaign, and use the Copilot assitant to configure the form without requiring domain knowledge.
